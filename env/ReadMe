To activate the virtual env and run the program, first  you have to install pip if you've never
used python or pip before. Next, you have to use pip to install the virtual enviornment tools as well as
all the packages that will be needed.
Open the CMD in the project folder area and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt

this will install all the packages.
Next, with your cmd still open in the project folder type:
env\Scripts\activate

this will turn on the virtual enviornment (to leave, type deactivate in the cmd)
Now, to run the program just type server.py and a web browser window should open up!
